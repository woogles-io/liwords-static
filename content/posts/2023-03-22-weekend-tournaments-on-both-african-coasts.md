Woogler [Okechi](https://woogles.io/profile/Okechi) contacted us about hosting a tournament for some youths in Kenya a few days ago. We set up a tournament room for him and they had a 13-game rapid tournament, with 10-minute games. You can see the games and final results here: <https://woogles.io/tournament/kenyayouthmarch23>

The winning game featured such plays as POCKeTER, MIDLINES, ZEAtINS, and NOINTER. Congrats to [TKayK](https://woogles.io/profile/TKayK) for winning the whole thing!

Meanwhile, Lukeman contacted me to set up a quick birthday tournament for a pal. I set up the tournament in this room: [https://woogles.io/tournament/yasobday](https://woogles.io/tournament/yasobday). This was a 15-game, 15 min/player tourney which lasted till the late afternoon and featured some of the top players in the world, including former World Champion [Wellington Jighere](https://woogles.io/profile/WELLINGTONJ), who you can see in this fun [viral YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rbIGvXey-e8). Many other Nigerian players rounded out a stellar cast and produced some very impressive games. 

Congrats to both directors who were able to run these tournaments seamlessly as well! If you want to run a tournament using our tournament mode, please be sure to read our tournament guides - you can find these in the menu above. (Or click [here](https://blog.woogles.io/guides))
