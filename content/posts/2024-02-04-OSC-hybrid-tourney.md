On Feb 3, OSC held our second hybrid house tournament and potluck at clubmate Gerda's house. It was another great time, slightly smaller turnout, with 8 NWL players (including Brian, playing from home on woogles -- thanks so much to Arthur for monitoring remotely!) and 6 CSW players -- with yours truly, Director Heidi Robertson, racing to the bottom of the pack, as I always do. üòè

I was also fortunate enough to have some incredibly wonderful and generous streamers donate their time to stream on my behalf -- the incomparable Will Anderson, who guest-hosted on my channel (https://www.twitch.tv/heroinetobirds), and Emma, who streamed on her own channel - https://www.twitch.tv/gurchy. Thank you so much for turning my mediocre Scrabble playing into such entertaining content for the viewers! üôÇ
