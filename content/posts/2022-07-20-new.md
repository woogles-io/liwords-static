Welcome!

You can stay informed about what's going on behind the scenes at Woogles.io on our new blog site. It is divided into three sections:

#### Articles

Articles can be written by anyone about OMGWords, word games, strategy, technology, etc. Basically, if you think our audience will like it, get in touch with us and write an article!

#### Blog

The blog will mainly contain posts by our Woogles team members about plans for the site, new features, and more. This is where we discuss what we've been developing and what is yet to come! We will also post about past and upcoming tournaments and other site events.

#### Guides

Guides are in-depth articles about specific Woogles features. We hope these make the features easier to use.
