As our site grows (we've been hitting more than 200 concurrent games multiple times in the last couple of weeks!) the help chat has become more cluttered and not fulfilling its original purpose. We've made the decision to close the help chat. However, you still have several options for getting help and/or chatting.

If you wish to socialize, join our Discord where you can meet other Wooglers. We have a vibrant community with many different channels and topics. You can share moves, OMGWords gifs, discuss strategy, talk about the nitty-gritty technical details of our app, our bot AI, Aerolith, and much much more. You can join here: <https://discord.gg/GqkUqA7ENm> -- note: you must be 13 or older to participate. 

You can also ask questions on our Discord #general channel about how to use the app.

For new players, we also have a Woogles guide here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwpVpyGYB9sMyk1xWTnNPBa92j2y1aMqZ-aArXTZSco/edit?usp=sharing>

**How about tournament announcements?**

An enterprising player (Raman) has taken it upon himself to announce tournaments for the community on our help chat. We're very thankful for his efforts. We have multiple weekly tournaments, and you can find details and a schedule on Discord and here: <https://woogles.io/clubs>[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwpVpyGYB9sMyk1xWTnNPBa92j2y1aMqZ-aArXTZSco/edit?usp=sharing)

In the future, we will integrate this with the rest of the app to make it easier to discover and sign up for tournaments.

**Thank you for Woogling!**

We want to thank you all for your support. We recently hit 6 million played games. Wow! Here's to many million more, and keep on Woogling - we have many awesome features in the pipeline![](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwpVpyGYB9sMyk1xWTnNPBa92j2y1aMqZ-aArXTZSco/edit?usp=sharing)
