Season 1 of our correspondence leagues is in the books, and what a start it was.

### The Numbers

99 of you showed up for our inaugural season - 75 in CSW and 24 in NWL. Honestly, we weren't sure what to expect, but you awesome Wooglers jumped in and made it work. Thank you for that! And thank you to all new Wooglers for trying out our site!

### Your Champions

Congrats to our first-ever season winners:

CSW (Collins): jellomochas (Alec Sjoholm), two-time former US National Champion. If you've played Alec, you know - the guy is just as dangerous when he has hours to think as when he has
minutes.

NWL: alex (Alex Jaech), a strong expert who played a great season and earned the win.

Great job, you two! 🏆

In CSW, congrats also to the following winners in Divisions 2 through 5: KongCH, zzz, AnitaCH, and Desertrain! You earned a promotion! (Sorry Alec/x, we can't promote you)


### What We Heard

We ran a survey after the season, and a lot of you said you'd prefer shorter seasons. Fair enough! Season 2 will start December 4, 2025 - a week earlier than originally planned.

We've also adjusted time controls a bit. Turn time is now 10 hours, but the time bank per game is down to 48 hours. This should give you a little more flexibility on busy days without letting
games stretch on too long.

Oh, and one more thing: starting with future seasons, we're expanding promotion and relegation to about 4 players per division for the CSW league instead of 3. (Season 1 stays at 3 - we're not changing the
rules on you mid-season, don't worry.)

This may change in future seasons as the league stabilizes; we want to make sure that people make their way into their correct divisions more quickly :)

### Registration for next season

If you get an error saying you need to be invited, please request an invite in the league chat. We may remove this requirement in the future. For now, almost everyone who's already played in Season 1 can come back without requesting another invite.

And hey, if you know any NWL players who've been lurking - give them a nudge. We'd love to have enough folks for multiple NWL
divisions this time.

### Thank You

Big thanks to everyone who helped get Season 1 off the ground. Especially **KaydeR**, who spent countless hours promoting the league and playing practice games with people new to Woogles. You're the best!

And thank you, all of you, for continuing to be part of this. Elliott built something special, and it means a lot that you trust us to keep it going.

See you in Season 2. Let's make it even bigger!
