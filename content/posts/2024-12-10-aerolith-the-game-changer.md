Word learning is as important as playing word games and one such site that I personally recommend is <https://aerolith.org> - it has got all the flavors!

As soon as you log in, you come across the below tabs and this where you need to click on Wordwalls.

WordWalls consists of everything a learner could dream of. It has many tabs - let‚Äôs discuss each of them separately.

### Word Search

It lets you set any criteria to your liking. You may select the length from **min 7 to max 8** and click on the + sign to add more criteria **\[Probability range] 1 to 100 for day one and next day you may try 101 to 200**. This is ideally how new players should begin.

### Aerolith Lists

These are Aerolith Customized lists. You may select any list of your
choice and you can always change the Minutes and Questions per
rounds. You may also change the lexicon by hovering the cursor over
to NWL23 and on the dropdown you may select CSW24.

### Single-Player Challenges

This is one of the favorite features of tournament players that they
use on a daily basis. You may select any word length and pick any
Challenge data. The minutes and Questions per round can not be
changed. It is an exam! Click on Play after making your selection.

After clicking Play, a window will appear where you will have to
click on **Ready to start** button. You will have 5 minutes to type
correct answers. Check how many bingos you can see, just type them
and then analyze your results. I selected 7 as word length in the picture below.

Once the game is over, click on Show solutions.

Have a look at the missed words; Click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù right after
finishing the daily challenge. It will quiz you on the missed ones
and then you can keep clicking ‚ÄúStart‚Äù until the list is finally
done. Congratulations! You have done it. Further, you can redo the
same challenge again if you want to test your memory or power of
recognition

You may also save these in google or excel sheet by selecting the
range, copying them and then pasting them on daily basis and you can
review these words whenever you want.

If you find some of words as favorites, you can save them in a
notepad file. Keep accumulating and saving them!

I recall back in October last year, it was the second game of our
monthly PSA tournament, I drew handful of tiles from the tile bag and
after placing them on the rack, that was it. AMPUTEE! It was
challenged by Bilal Asher who is an amazingly talented youth
player. The word to his surprise was valid, thanks to Aerolith daily
word challenge. In the daily word challenge lists we come across the
common words to the most difficult ones and that‚Äôs the fun part.  

For players motivation, there is a leaderboard where they can find
their names and compare their progress with others.

### Saved lists

You can add some words in a notepad list for uploading on
Aerolith.

You can save as many customized lists as you want for practice.
Usually players would save the most missed words, weirder ones or the
ones with difficult spellings or their favorite words.

 After creating your list with Notepad, you can upload the text file by clicking or dragging-and-dropping it to the box at the bottom of the picture.

Aerolith is fun: Some use it for word learning and some find it an
examination hall üòä

The good part about Aerolith is that you don‚Äôt have to install it as it is web
based and you may use it wherever you want.

Happy Word Studying on Aerolith!

*Part 2 of this blog will come soon, featuring Aerolith WordVault, a recent addition to Aerolith that helps you learn words with spaced repetition!*
