Hey Wooglers! 

 Woogles.io is pleased to announce the Wooglevark tournament! This weekend-long tournament, held online on Woogles.io from Oct 25 to Oct 26, will pay out USD cash prizes to the highest finishers â€“ with an expected prize pool of $2,000 USD if the 80-player cap is hit. Both NWL23 and CSW24 play will be supported. Entry fee is $20 and must be paid at least 7 days prior to the tournament to hold a spot. Entries are limited to 40 players in both NWL23 and CSW24 divisions. 

The Wooglevark tournament is to honor Mike Thelen (AKA Boshvark) and his generous donation to the Woogles project during our kickstarter days. Thanks Mike!
