Hey Wooglers, you may have spotted a new type of badge circulating on our site, adjacent to our existing dog-themed badges to recognize supporters. These new title badges indicate that the player has achieved over-the-board merit in either international or domestic competition (hovering over a badge shows details). In particular, we’re proud to showcase players’ [WESPA titles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_XymBg7_GWPCg7nXggLzyR-wsJz5rLK_/view?fbclid=IwY2xjawPRbNZleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFjbUF1czZ3NDFtSDg0VzRPc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHuqmKrqXw25hh7z79YqLVXWjXSHU7wNDLD-WVjAPSkzk8n4RlS_gPZnBxm1Y_aem_E5vfR5LWxlhnazgkWJQXjA), reflecting the [global system](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_gLMJwCO34mOAIODE27QZbo80q9O4X7/view?fbclid=IwY2xjawPRbENleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFjbUF1czZ3NDFtSDg0VzRPc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHuqmKrqXw25hh7z79YqLVXWjXSHU7wNDLD-WVjAPSkzk8n4RlS_gPZnBxm1Y_aem_E5vfR5LWxlhnazgkWJQXjA) recently introduced this year by WESPA (World English Scrabble Players Association). Right now titles can only be obtained by playing in-person tournaments and are not awared based on your online performance on Woogles - no matter how high your rating is.

All title badges seen on Woogles are verified! You can verify on your own by visiting [https://woogles.io/settings/integrations](https://woogles.io/settings/integrations), or manually by contacting César via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/WjQCn4eA). Your authenticating information remains secure at all times and is immediately deleted post-authentication. So far we support WESPA and NASPA badges. If you represent a title-issuing national organization and want your titles to appear on Woogles (and ideally, can assist with technical integration), please reach out to our team at woogles@woogles.io.

At Woogles, we’re proud to highlight the peak of competitive word gaming, and give every player at every level the tools to become a grandmaster themselves one day. How many titled players can you defeat? Even Nigel Richards has been known to play on our site.

-Happy Woogling from GM Jesse Day
